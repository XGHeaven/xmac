# xMac

I have some command used very frequently. 
Such as `ifconfig` to find ip, `netstat` to find out which program listen port.
But as you know, that tools is powerful, also complex.

I write easy tools collection to pretty output of above tools for easy read.

xMac's meaning is XGHeaven Mac command tools.

# Tools

* [ ] `port` which port you progress listen on, easy to look up

# Usage

xmac [tools]
```

so easy to use
